# A-Hybrid-AI-and-Computer-Vision-Framework-for-Improved-Drought-Prediction-in-Pakistan-
This project aims to develop a vision-based drought prediction system that uses spectral and temporal information from satellites to monitor vegetation stress and soil conditions. By focusing solely on computer vision techniques, this approach reduces dependency on multi-modal fusion systems and external environmental sensors.

ðŸ“˜ HOW TO USE (Must Read)

This system predicts drought severity using satellite imagery from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8. Follow these steps carefully to run the pipeline:

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Upload Dataset

Start by uploading the required satellite bands to your Colab or working directory:

* `B03.jp2` â€“ Green band (Sentinel-2)
* `B04.jp2` â€“ Red band (Sentinel-2)
* `B08.jp2` â€“ Near Infrared band (Sentinel-2)
* `B10.TIF` â€“ Thermal Infrared band (Landsat 8 Band 10)
* `MeTaL.txt` â€“ Metadata file from Landsat (for LST calibration)

These files are mandatory for feature extraction and drought classification.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Run Feature Extraction Code

Execute the code block to calculate:

* NDVI (Vegetation health)
* NDWI (Water content)
* LST (Land Surface Temperature)
* GLCM contrast and Wavelet energy

The output will include vegetation maps, a color-coded drought risk map, and feature scores.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Optional: Deep Learning Prediction

If you're using the deep learning model:

* Upload or generate the `.h5` model file (e.g., `cv_drought_vit.h5`)
* Upload 6 `.npy` NDVI stacks (e.g., `ndvi_Jan.npy`, `ndvi_Feb.npy`, etc.)
* Upload a `true_labels.npy` file if you want to evaluate accuracy

The model will output:

* Pixel-wise class predictions (Normal, Moderate, Severe)
* Accuracy, Precision, F1 Score, and a confusion matrix

### ðŸ“Œ Notes

* All `.jp2`, `.TIF`, and `.npy` files must be uploaded before running
* Colab may require re-uploading files after each restart
* You may edit the NDVI threshold logic or model structure as needed
